### Employee Performance Dataset (AMML_dataset.xlsx):

This dataset contains real-life performance data of new employees, including demographic information and test scores. It serves as the basis for writing machine learning code as part of the assignment for the course "Advanced Linear Algebra for Machine Learning" (ALA).

The repository includes the following files:

- **20bcs020_ALA.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file containing the machine learning code for analyzing the employee performance dataset.
- **ALA_assignment-questions.pdf**: PDF file containing the assignment questions related to the ALA course.
- **AMML_dataset.xlsx**: Excel file containing the employee performance dataset.

The solutions to the assignment questions can be found within the notebook file (20bcs020_ALA.ipynb), while the dataset (AMML_dataset.xlsx) is used for implementing the machine learning algorithms.
